When the client connects it sends a 4 byte value (in network byte order) â€“ the requested offset into the content. 
The server responds with up to 260 bytes in its response. The first four bytes of the response, if returned, is 
always the length of the content in network byte order. If the offset exceeds the length of the content, the server 
returns only the length of the content. Otherwise, some additional bytes returned are returned (between 0 and 
256 bytes; the exact number seems to be random). To get more bytes the client must sleep for 1 second then 
create a new TCP connection. Failed network read/write errors should not stop the client retrying connections. 
A difficult server will occasionally accept the connection but just close the connection without any reply.
A stubborn server is trickier; it will may return just the 4 byte length and always refuse to return any content for 
a few specific (non-zero) offset values. Your intelligent client will thus need to adjust their request accordingly.
